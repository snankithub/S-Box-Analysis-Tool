### Purpose of S-Box Analysis in Symmetric Cryptography

S-Box analysis tools are critical for ensuring the strength of symmetric ciphers by evaluating the mathematical and cryptographic robustness of S-boxes. These tools analyze several properties that contribute to cipher security:

1. **Non-Linearity**: Ensures resistance against linear cryptanalysis by measuring how far the S-box deviates from linear functions.
2. **SAC (Strict Avalanche Criterion)**: Ensures that flipping one input bit changes approximately half of the output bits.
3. **BIC (Bit Independence Criterion)**: Verifies that output bits change independently of each other after an input bit flip.
4. **Differential and Linear Approximation Tables (DAT/LAT)**: Quantify probabilities of input-output correlations, assessing resistance to differential and linear cryptanalysis.
5. **Differential/Linear Probability**: Measures the likelihood of specific differentials or linear correlations; lower values imply higher security.
6. **NL-BIC/SAC-BIC Tables**: Provide integrated metrics combining non-linearity and avalanche properties with bit independence.

These analyses help design and validate cryptographically strong S-boxes for algorithms like AES. By identifying weaknesses, they ensure resilience against common attacks, enhancing encryption reliability.

Key Properties
Non-linearity:

Definition: Measures the resistance of an S-box to linear approximations.
Importance: High non-linearity makes the S-box resistant to linear cryptanalysis.
Operation: Compares the S-box output against linear functions.
Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC):

Definition: A small change in input (flipping one bit) should cause a significant, unpredictable change in output.
Importance: Ensures the S-box introduces sufficient diffusion.
Operation: Tests output variations against bit flips.
Bit Independence Criterion (BIC):

Definition: Ensures output bits are independent of each other after an input bit flip.
Importance: Prevents correlation between output bits.
Operation: Examines cross-dependencies among output bits.
Differential Approximation Table (DAT) and Linear Approximation Table (LAT):

Definition: Evaluate resistance to differential and linear cryptanalysis, respectively.
Importance: Measure probabilities of differential and linear approximations.
Operation: Analyze transitions and correlations over input-output pairs.
Differential Probability (DP) and Linear Probability (LP):

Definition: Probability of specific differential or linear approximations.
Importance: Low DP and LP indicate high cryptographic strength.
Operation: Compute probabilities from DAT and LAT.
NL-BIC Table and SAC-BIC Table:

Definition: Combine non-linearity and SAC with BIC for comprehensive analysis.
Importance: Provide an integrated view of S-box strength.
Operation: Quantify combined properties through advanced computations.
